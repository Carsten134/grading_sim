## Grading simulation to assess effects of grading

For more information look [here](https://carsten134.github.io/portfolio-website/projects/grading-policies). 

For the gradeing-policy i needed a concanve part and a convex part. The concave one was:

$$
f(x) = x^{-b} \hspace{1em} b\in(0,1)
$$

The closer $b$ to 0, the more concave the function became

For the convex part i just used:

$$
g(x) = x^c
$$

The higher c the more convex the function.

I also needed to stitch the function together at an arbitrary point $x\in[0,1]^2$. This why the functions become kind of complicated.
